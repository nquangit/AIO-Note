# Introduction

> Serverless Computing Service

AWS Lambda is like having a robot helper that automatically does tasks for you whenever you need it. Let me explain it to you in simple terms:

Imagine that you have a lot of tasks to do, like cleaning your room, washing the dishes, and doing your homework. Normally, you would have to do these tasks yourself, or ask someone else to help you.

But with AWS Lambda, you can create a program that automatically does tasks for you whenever you need it. Just like how a robot helper can do tasks for you without you having to do them yourself.

For example, let’s say you want to create a program that automatically sends you an email every time someone comments on your YouTube video. You can write a program using AWS Lambda that automatically checks for new comments and sends you an email when there is one.

AWS Lambda also takes care of the technical details of running the program, like managing the server and resources needed to run it. This means that you don’t have to worry about setting up and maintaining your own server.

So, to summarize, AWS Lambda is like having a robot helper that automatically does tasks for you whenever you need it. You can create a program that runs on AWS Lambda to do tasks for you automatically, and AWS Lambda takes care of the technical details of running the program.
