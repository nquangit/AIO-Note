## **Perform Log Analysis for Intrusions**

Log analysis helps detect unusual activity that might indicate a security threat. This project will guide you through setting up a log analysis environment, collecting logs (records of activity), and analyzing them to spot signs of intrusion (unauthorized access).

---

### Prerequisites
Before starting, it’s helpful to have:
- Basic knowledge of cybersecurity concepts (what logs are and why they matter)
- A computer with internet access
- Access to a logging and analysis tool, like the **ELK Stack** (a set of tools for collecting and viewing logs) or **Splunk** (a platform for analyzing machine data).

---

### Step-by-Step Guide

**Step 1: Set Up the Log Analysis Environment**

1. **Install the ELK Stack**  
   The ELK Stack includes three main tools:
   - **Elasticsearch**: Stores logs and allows you to search them.
   - **Logstash**: Collects logs from different sources and forwards them to Elasticsearch.
   - **Kibana**: A dashboard that lets you visualize and analyze logs.

   - **Installation**: Follow the official guide to install the ELK Stack: [ELK Stack Installation Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack-get-started/current/get-started-elastic-stack.html).
   - Alternatively, use a managed ELK service (hosted online) like the **Elasticsearch Service** on Elastic Cloud, which requires no local setup: [Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service).

2. **Configure Logstash to Collect Logs**  
   Logstash needs a configuration file to know where to find logs, how to process them, and where to send them. You’ll create a file named `logstash.conf`.

   **Sample `logstash.conf`**:
   ```lua
   input {
     file {
       path => "/path/to/logs/*.log"  # Change to the path where your logs are stored
       start_position => "beginning"  # Ensures Logstash reads logs from the beginning
     }
     syslog {                         # Listens for logs from networked devices on port 514
       port => 514
     }
   }

   filter {
     grok {                           # Extracts data like timestamps and messages from logs
       match => { "message" => "%{SYSLOGTIMESTAMP:timestamp} %{WORD:logsource} %{GREEDYDATA:message}" }
     }
     date {                           # Formats the timestamp correctly for analysis
       match => [ "timestamp", "MMM  d HH:mm:ss", "MMM dd HH:mm:ss" ]
     }
   }

   output {
     elasticsearch {                  # Sends processed logs to Elasticsearch
       hosts => ["http://localhost:9200"]
       index => "logs-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}" # Names the log files by date
     }
     stdout { codec => rubydebug }    # Displays logs on the command line for testing
   }
   ```

3. **Start Logstash**  
   To start Logstash and apply your configuration file, enter the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   logstash -f logstash.conf
   ```

   - **Tip**: Replace `/path/to/logs` with the actual folder path where your logs are stored.

---

**Step 2: Collect Logs from Various Sources**

1. **System Logs**  
   System logs capture activity on a computer. Here’s how to collect them:
   - **Linux**:
     ```bash
     sudo cp /var/log/auth.log /path/to/logs/
     sudo cp /var/log/syslog /path/to/logs/
     ```
   - **Windows**: Use the **Event Viewer** to export important logs, like System and Security logs, to `.evtx` files.

2. **Application Logs**  
   Application logs record activity from specific programs, such as a web server.
   - **Example for Apache** (a common web server):
     ```bash
     sudo cp /var/log/apache2/access.log /path/to/logs/
     sudo cp /var/log/apache2/error.log /path/to/logs/
     ```

3. **Network Logs**  
   Network logs track data sent and received over networks. Set up network devices (e.g., routers, firewalls) to send **syslog** messages to Logstash.

4. **Security Tool Logs**  
   Security tools like **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** or antivirus programs can also send logs to Logstash. Configure each tool to forward its logs to Logstash’s `syslog` input.

---

**Step 3: Analyze Logs for Intrusions**

1. **Access Kibana**  
   Open Kibana in a web browser by going to `http://localhost:5601`. Here, you’ll configure **Kibana** to view logs from Elasticsearch:
   - Create an index pattern for the logs (e.g., `logs-*`) so Kibana knows where to look for the data.

2. **Create Dashboards and Visualizations**  
   Dashboards let you monitor log data easily. Here are some useful visualizations:
   - **Failed Login Attempts**: Create a bar chart showing failed login attempts over time.
   - **Unusual Network Activity**: Use a line chart to show traffic volume by IP address, helping you spot strange patterns.

3. **Set Up Alerts**  
   Kibana can notify you of suspicious activity with alerts:
   - **Multiple Failed Logins**: Trigger an alert for 5+ failed login attempts from the same IP within 10 minutes.
   - **High Traffic**: Alert if traffic from an IP exceeds a certain amount, which might indicate data theft.

4. **Investigate Suspicious Activity**  
   Use Kibana to look into anything unusual:
   - **Failed Logins**: Identify IP addresses, usernames, and times of failed logins.
   - **Network Traffic**: Investigate source/destination IPs, ports, and protocols in suspicious traffic.

---

**Step 4: Document the Findings**

1. **Create an Incident Report**  
   Documenting findings is crucial. Include these sections:
   - **Introduction**: Brief overview of the investigation’s purpose.
   - **Data Collection**: Summary of where you got the logs.
   - **Analysis**: Details of your Kibana visualizations and alerts.
   - **Findings**: Summarize any signs of intrusion.
   - **Conclusion**: Overall conclusions and any recommended next steps.

2. **Add Screenshots and Logs**  
   Include screenshots of visualizations or alerts that show suspicious activity. Attach logs to support your findings.

3. **Preserve Evidence**  
   If you uncover a real incident, save your findings securely. **Use encryption** and restrict access to authorized users only.

1. **Introduction**:
   - **Purpose**: This report documents the detection and response analysis conducted following unusual activity alerts. The primary purpose was to identify potential security incidents, assess their impact, and determine response actions.
   - **Scope**: The analysis included system, application, and network logs collected from key infrastructure, along with alerts from threat detection tools. Indicators of compromise (IoCs) were analyzed to identify patterns suggesting possible intrusions.

---

2. **Data Collection**:
   - **Sources of Logs**:
     - **System Logs**: Collected from Linux and Windows servers, capturing authentication and system events.
     - **Application Logs**: Retrieved from Apache web servers, detailing user requests and server error events.
     - **Network Logs**: Aggregated from firewalls and routers, focused on traffic patterns and connection logs.
     - **Security Tools Logs**: Integrated from IDS and antivirus alerts, including detections of known threat signatures and flagged suspicious activities.
   - **Methods**:
     - Logstash was used to standardize and aggregate logs, forwarding them to Elasticsearch for structured search and analysis. Logs were then analyzed using Kibana for visualization and anomaly detection.

---

3. **Analysis**:
   - **Visualizations and Dashboards**:
     - **Failed Login Attempts**: A bar chart was created in Kibana showing the frequency of failed login attempts by IP address over time, highlighting a spike in failed attempts from IP `192.168.1.100`.
     - **Outbound Traffic Volume**: A line chart displayed outbound network traffic by IP address. IP `203.0.113.1` was flagged for a sudden increase in data volume sent outside the network.
   - **Alerts**:
     - **Multiple Failed Login Attempts**: An alert was configured to trigger for 5+ failed login attempts within 10 minutes from the same IP. This alert triggered due to activity from IP `192.168.1.100`.
     - **High Network Traffic Alert**: A second alert was set to trigger when data volume exceeded typical thresholds to a non-whitelisted IP, which activated when IP `203.0.113.1` exhibited a large data transfer.
   - **Suspicious Activity Investigations**:
     - **Brute-Force Login Attempts**: The alert for failed logins was investigated by examining IP addresses, timestamps, and usernames involved. Findings indicated that the targeted accounts were privileged, suggesting a possible attempt to gain unauthorized access.
     - **Data Exfiltration Suspicion**: Outbound traffic to `203.0.113.1` was analyzed in detail. This external IP was not recognized and exhibited high data transfer volumes, indicating a potential data exfiltration attempt.

---

4. **Findings**:
   - **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
     - **Failed Login Attempts**: IP `192.168.1.100` was flagged for multiple failed login attempts targeting privileged accounts, indicating a potential brute-force attempt.
     - **High Volume Outbound Traffic**: IP `203.0.113.1` received an unusually high volume of data from internal network addresses within the `10.1.2.0/24` range, consistent with potential data exfiltration activity.
   - **Evidence of Malicious Activity**:
     - **Unauthorized Access Attempts**: Numerous login failures targeting critical accounts suggest an attempt to compromise administrative access.
     - **Suspicious Network Behavior**: A single external IP received significant data volume, which may indicate an attempt to extract data from the organization.

---

5. **Conclusion**:
   - **Overall Findings**: The analysis has identified possible brute-force login attempts and an unauthorized data exfiltration attempt. Key indicators of compromise include concentrated failed login attempts from IP `192.168.1.100` and a suspiciously high volume of data transfer to IP `203.0.113.1`.
   - **Recommended Actions**:
     - **Immediate Access Control**: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all privileged accounts and enforce lockout thresholds to prevent brute-force attacks.
     - **Strengthen Network Monitoring**: Deploy data loss prevention (DLP) systems to monitor and control outbound data flow to unknown IP addresses.
     - **Policy Review**: Conduct a thorough review of access policies and configure additional alerts for any repeated login failures or unusual traffic patterns.
