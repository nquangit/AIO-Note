### Project: Secure Network Design

Designing a **secure network architecture** is essential in cybersecurity to protect data, ensure safe access, and prevent unauthorized activities. This guide will walk you through designing a network that incorporates security best practices and essential components, such as firewalls, network segmentation, and secure access controls.

---

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you should have:
- **Basic knowledge of computer networking** – understanding of how devices like routers, switches, and servers work together.
- **Familiarity with cybersecurity principles** – knowledge of concepts like firewalls, intrusion detection, and encryption.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Designing a Secure Network

---

#### Step 1: Define Network Requirements

Understanding the needs and goals of the network helps you create a solid foundation for its design.

1. **Identify Business Needs**:
   - **Understand daily operations**: Identify essential services, like file storage, email, and internet access.
   - **Determine the number of users and devices**: This includes employees, servers, and other networked devices.

2. **Assess Security Requirements**:
   - Identify **sensitive data** that needs protection (e.g., customer data, financial records).
   - Determine if the business must comply with **security regulations** like GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) or HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act).
   - **Evaluate potential threats**: Consider risks such as data breaches, phishing attacks, and unauthorized access.

3. **Plan for Scalability**:
   - Design your network to allow easy expansion as the business grows, adding users, devices, or services without weakening security.

#### Step 2: Design the Network Topology

Network topology refers to the structure of the network, including how different devices and segments connect.

1. **Network Segmentation**:
   - Divide the network into **subnets** (segments) to improve security and performance.
   - Create separate segments for different departments, like **HR, Finance, and IT**.
   - **Isolate sensitive systems** (like database servers) on their own subnet, away from general access.

   - **Tip**: Network segmentation limits the spread of threats by separating different types of traffic and access levels.

2. **Perimeter Network (DMZ)**:
   - Set up a **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)** for public-facing services (e.g., web and email servers). A DMZ is a segment that sits between the public internet and your internal network.
   - This separation protects internal resources by keeping external services isolated.

3. **Core Network**:
   - Design the **core network** to connect all segments and provide high-speed, reliable connectivity.
   - Include **redundancy** (like multiple routers) to prevent downtime if one device fails.

4. **Access Layer**:
   - This layer connects end-user devices (like computers and phones) to the network.
   - **Restrict access** based on device and user permissions to prevent unauthorized connections.

#### Step 3: Select Network Devices

Choosing the right hardware is essential for security and performance.

1. **Firewalls**:
   - Choose **next-generation firewalls (NGFWs)**, which include advanced features like intrusion prevention and deep packet inspection.
   - Place firewalls at critical points in the network, such as between the **internet and DMZ** and between the **DMZ and internal network**.

2. **Routers and Switches**:
   - Select **routers and switches** that support **VLANs (Virtual LANs)** for creating network segments.
   - Make sure these devices support **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**, which allow you to control traffic flow based on rules.

3. **Access Points (for Wi-Fi)**:
   - Choose access points that support **WPA3** encryption for secure wireless access.
   - Segment the wireless network by creating separate Wi-Fi networks, for instance, for employees and guests.

4. **Servers**:
   - Choose servers with appropriate specifications based on their use (e.g., web server, email server, database server).
   - **Harden servers** by disabling unnecessary services and keeping software up-to-date with security patches.

#### Step 4: Implement Security Best Practices

With your network structure in place, implement key security measures.

1. **Network Access Control (NAC)**:
   - Use **NAC** to enforce security policies on devices connecting to the network.
   - Authenticate devices and check their compliance with security policies, such as up-to-date antivirus.

2. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**:
   - Deploy **IDS/IPS** to monitor traffic for suspicious activity and block malicious traffic.
   - Place IDS/IPS sensors at strategic points, like between the **internet and DMZ** and within the internal network.

3. **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**:
   - Use a **VPN** to secure remote access, allowing employees to connect securely from outside the office.
   - Implement **strong encryption and authentication** for VPN connections to protect data in transit.

4. **Network Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Set up **network monitoring** to track performance and spot unusual activity.
   - Use **centralized logging** to collect logs from devices like firewalls, servers, and switches, helping you analyze incidents and detect patterns.

5. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing**:
   - **Conduct security audits** to check the effectiveness of security measures.
   - Perform **penetration testing** to find and fix vulnerabilities before they’re exploited by attackers.

#### Step 5: Configure Network Devices

With the security structure in place, it’s time to configure each device according to the security plan.

1. **Firewalls**:
   - Set up firewall rules to allow necessary traffic and block unauthorized access.
   - Use **application-level filtering** to control specific types of traffic (e.g., only allowing certain applications to access the internet).

2. **Routers and Switches**:
   - Configure **VLANs** on switches to segment the network and prevent different types of traffic from mixing.
   - Use **ACLs (Access Control Lists)** to define which traffic is allowed between segments.

3. **Access Points**:
   - Set up Wi-Fi SSIDs and security settings, making sure WPA3 is enabled.
   - Disable older protocols like **WEP/WPA**, which are less secure, to prevent weaker connections.

4. **Servers**:
   - Regularly apply **security patches and updates** to protect against known vulnerabilities.
   - Configure firewalls on servers to restrict access to specific services and IP ranges.

---

#### Step 6: Document the Network Design

Documentation is crucial for maintaining and troubleshooting the network.

1. **Network Diagram**:
   - Use a tool like **draw.io** to create a detailed network diagram.
   - Include all segments, devices, and connections, which will help anyone working on the network understand its layout.

2. **Configuration Details**:
   - Record configuration settings for all devices, including IP addresses, VLAN assignments, firewall rules, and security settings.
   - **Tip**: Keep the documentation up-to-date, especially when making changes to the network.

### Conclusion

You have successfully designed a secure network architecture for a small to medium-sized business. This includes network segmentation, perimeter security with a DMZ, and the implementation of essential security best practices. Regularly review and update your network design to adapt to changes in business needs and to address new security threats. This proactive approach will help maintain a strong, secure network over time.
