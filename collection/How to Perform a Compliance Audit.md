## Step 2: Using the Home Network Cybersecurity Checklist

You will now go through each section of the [[Home Network Security Checklist]] provided above to assess the network and devices. Use the checklist items to verify compliance and document evidence for each control.

### How to Use the Checklist

1. **Network Security**:
   - Go through each control under Network Security in the checklist.
   - Verify that the Wi-Fi network uses WPA2/WPA3 encryption, has a strong password, and has firmware updates applied.
   - **Example Evidence**: Screenshot of the router’s security settings, Wi-Fi password strength verification, firmware version confirmation.

2. **Device Security**:
   - For each personal device (e.g., laptop, smartphone), check that antivirus software is installed, updates are enabled, and encryption is turned on.
   - **Example Evidence**: Screenshot of antivirus software status, OS update settings, and confirmation of device encryption.

3. **Access Control**:
   - Assess access controls on the network and devices. Confirm that each device has strong passwords, two-factor authentication (2FA) for accounts, and unique user accounts.
   - **Example Evidence**: Account login settings, confirmation of 2FA settings, device access logs (if available).

4. **Data Protection and Backup**:
   - Check for backups of critical data, secure data disposal practices, and encryption for sensitive data.
   - **Example Evidence**: Screenshot of backup settings, proof of encryption for important files, secure file deletion or wiping practices.

5. **Incident Response and Monitoring**:
   - Look for logging and monitoring settings on the router and any devices that support them. Ensure that an incident response plan is in place, even if basic.
   - **Example Evidence**: Router log settings, documentation of steps to take if a security incident occurs.

6. **User Awareness and Training**:
   - Check for security awareness among users. Verify that users know about phishing risks, use strong password practices, and report suspicious activity.
   - **Example Evidence**: Questionnaire responses or interview notes, proof of password manager use.

7. **IoT and Smart Device Security**:
   - Evaluate the security of IoT devices. Ensure that default passwords are changed, firmware is updated, and devices are on a separate network if possible.
   - **Example Evidence**: Screenshot of device settings, confirmation of firmware version, IoT network segmentation setup.

---

## Step 3: Evaluating and Documenting Findings

1. **Document Compliance Status**:
   - For each checklist item, record whether it is **Compliant**, **Non-Compliant**, or **Not Applicable** in the **Audit Findings** section of your document.

2. **Collect Evidence**:
   - For each finding, include evidence in the form of screenshots, photos, or notes that support your assessment.
   - Example Evidence Table Entry:

| Checklist Item                           | Compliance Status | Evidence                                                                | Risk Level |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| WPA2/WPA3 encryption on Wi-Fi            | Compliant        | Screenshot of router security settings showing WPA2 encryption enabled  | High       |
| Automatic updates on personal devices    | Non-Compliant    | OS update settings screenshot showing updates disabled                  | High       |
| IoT device password changed from default | Compliant        | Photo of IoT settings showing custom password                           | Medium     |

3. **Highlight High-Risk Non-Compliance Items**:
   - Identify any items marked as Non-Compliant, especially those with a High-risk level.
   - These items should be prioritized in the recommendations.

---

## Step 4: Creating an Audit Report

Once you’ve completed the checklist and documented findings, compile everything into a formal **Compliance Audit Report**. This report should include a summary of the audit scope, findings, and actionable recommendations.

### Report Structure

1. **Executive Summary**:
   - Briefly summarize the audit’s purpose, scope, and high-level findings.
   - Example: “This compliance audit was conducted on the personal network of [Friend/Family Member’s Name] to assess cybersecurity best practices. The audit revealed compliance with most device security controls but identified areas for improvement in patch management and user awareness.”

2. **Audit Scope and Objectives**:
   - Detail the specific devices and network components reviewed and the audit’s objectives.

3. **Audit Findings**:
   - Summarize the compliance status of each checklist item.
   - Provide a table with findings and corresponding evidence.

4. **Recommendations for Improvement**:
   - For each non-compliant item, recommend specific actions to correct it.
   - Example Recommendations:
     - **Wi-Fi Security**: Change the Wi-Fi password to a complex, unique password using at least 12 characters.
     - **Automatic Updates**: Enable automatic updates on all personal devices to improve patch management.
     - **Phishing Awareness**: Educate users on phishing indicators and secure password practices.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Summarize the overall compliance status and suggest next steps, such as re-assessment in three months after recommended actions are implemented.

## Step 5: Making Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Prioritize High-Risk Areas**:
   - Highlight areas with High-risk, Non-Compliant items, such as lack of encryption or poor password practices, in your recommendations.
   - Explain why each recommendation is critical to improving the home network’s security.

2. **Provide Practical Next Steps**:
   - Include clear, actionable steps for each recommendation.
   - Example: "To enable automatic updates on your device, go to Settings > System > Updates, and toggle on 'Automatic Updates.' This will ensure your device is patched against vulnerabilities as soon as updates are available."

3. **Set a Timeline for Re-assessment**:
   - Recommend re-assessment within a specific timeframe (e.g., three months) to check that all non-compliant items have been addressed.

---

### Final Deliverables

1. **Home Network Audit Checklist** (Completed)  
   - A fully completed checklist with compliance status and evidence for each control.

2. **Compliance Audit Report**  
   - A formal report with the Executive Summary, Scope and Objectives, Audit Findings, Recommendations, and Conclusion.

---

### Reflection Questions

1. Which areas of the home network presented the most significant security risks, and why?
2. How did using the checklist help guide the audit process?
3. What would you recommend as an ongoing process for maintaining compliance with these best practices in a home environment?

By following this lab, you’ll gain a structured approach to performing compliance audits and using audit checklists effectively. This experience will be invaluable for anyone pursuing a career in GRC or cybersecurity auditing.
