# Non-repudiation (Cybersecurity)

**Non-repudiation** in cybersecurity refers to the assurance that someone cannot deny the authenticity of their signature, communication, or action. It ensures that the origin, [[integrity]], and receipt of data or transactions are verified, making it impossible for a party to dispute having sent or received the information. Non-repudiation is a critical principle for trust in digital communications and transactions.

## Key Features

- **Proof of Origin:** Ensures that the sender of a message or transaction cannot deny having sent it.
- **Proof of Receipt:** Ensures that the recipient cannot deny having received the message or transaction.
- **[[Digital Signature|Digital Signatures]]:** Cryptographic mechanisms that provide evidence of both the sender’s identity and the [[integrity]] of the message or document.
- **Audit Trails:** A detailed record of actions taken, providing evidence that can be used to confirm non-repudiation in the event of a dispute.

## Problem Addressed

Non-repudiation addresses the problem of ensuring that parties involved in digital communications or transactions cannot falsely claim they did not participate. This is especially important in legal, financial, and contractual settings where a party’s accountability for their actions must be guaranteed. Without non-repudiation, users could dispute their involvement in key actions, leading to potential fraud or legal issues.

## Implications

- **Accountability:** Non-repudiation enforces accountability, ensuring that parties cannot deny actions they have taken, such as sending a message, authorizing a transaction, or signing a document.
- **Trust in Digital Transactions:** It is essential for establishing trust in online communications, e-commerce, and other digital interactions, where face-to-face verification is impossible.
- **Legal Protection:** Provides legal evidence that can be used in court to prove that a specific action was taken by a particular party, preventing disputes over digital agreements or contracts.

## Impact

- **Secure E-commerce:** Non-repudiation ensures that customers and vendors cannot deny making purchases or fulfilling orders, protecting both parties in online transactions.
- **Digital Contracts:** Ensures that signatories of digital contracts cannot deny their involvement, making digital agreements legally enforceable.
- **Email [[Integrity]]:** When implemented in secure email systems, non-repudiation ensures that the sender and recipient cannot dispute the authenticity of their communications.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **[[Digital Signature|Digital Signatures]]:** Digital signatures use [[cryptographic algorithms]] (e.g., **[[RSA]]** or **[[Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm|ECDSA]]**) to confirm the sender’s identity and verify that the message has not been altered. A valid digital signature provides non-repudiation, as it uniquely links the message to the sender.
- **[[Public Key Infrastructure]] (PKI):** PKI systems issue digital certificates that bind a [[public key]] to an individual or organization, providing strong non-repudiation when [[Digital Signature|digital signatures]] are used.
- **Timestamping:** Attaching a secure, verifiable timestamp to a message or transaction ensures that the action occurred at a specific time, further strengthening non-repudiation.
- **Audit Logs:** Detailed records of system activities can serve as proof that a particular user or system took specific actions, providing additional evidence in non-repudiation scenarios.
- **Hashing:** Hashing [[Algorithm|algorithms]] (e.g., **[[SHA-256]]**) can be used to generate a unique fingerprint of data or messages, ensuring that their content remains unchanged after transmission or storage.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

- **Key Compromise:** If a user’s [[private key]] is stolen or compromised, an attacker could forge [[Digital Signature|digital signatures]], compromising the non-repudiation mechanism.
- **Misuse of Digital Certificates:** If certificate authorities (CAs) are compromised or issue certificates incorrectly, it could lead to false claims of authenticity.
- **Weak [[Cryptographic Algorithms]]:** Using outdated or weak cryptographic methods (e.g., **[[MD5]]**) can make [[Digital Signature|digital signatures]] vulnerable to forgery, undermining non-repudiation.
- **Lack of Secure Audit Trails:** If audit logs are not properly secured, attackers could modify or delete evidence of actions, weakening non-repudiation.
- **User Error or Mismanagement:** If users do not securely manage their private keys or certificates, they could accidentally invalidate the non-repudiation process by losing control over their cryptographic credentials.

## Common Tools/Software

- **Digital Signature Services:** Tools like **DocuSign**, **Adobe Sign**, and **HelloSign** provide legally enforceable [[Digital Signature|digital signatures]] that support non-repudiation in digital agreements.
- **[[Public Key Infrastructure]] (PKI) Systems:** Platforms such as **Microsoft Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS)** or **OpenSSL** manage digital certificates, ensuring that [[Digital Signature|digital signatures]] are securely tied to individuals or organizations.
- **Email Security Tools:** Solutions like **[[Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)|PGP]]** and **S/MIME** enable email [[encryption]] and [[Digital Signature|digital signatures]], providing non-repudiation in secure email communications.
- **Audit Logging Solutions:** Tools like **Splunk**, **Graylog**, and **LogRhythm** capture and store detailed logs of user and system actions, ensuring secure, tamper-proof records that support non-repudiation.
- **[[Blockchain Technology|Blockchain]] Technology:** In decentralized systems, [[Blockchain Technology|blockchain]]'s immutable [[Decentralized Ledgers|ledger]] can ensure non-repudiation by providing an unchangeable record of transactions and actions.

## Current Status

Non-repudiation is an essential principle in the modern digital landscape, particularly for online transactions, contracts, and secure communications. As e-commerce, cloud computing, and remote work become more prevalent, the need for robust non-repudiation mechanisms is growing. New technologies like **[[Blockchain Technology|blockchain]]** are also emerging as powerful tools for ensuring non-repudiation in distributed systems.
