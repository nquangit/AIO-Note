### Objectives

1. **Identify and assess** cybersecurity risks on personal devices and home networks.
2. **Create documentation** to analyze and evaluate identified risks.
3. **Develop recommendations** to improve security and reduce risk on personal devices and networks.
4. **Apply GRC principles** in a way that relates to personal security and privacy.

---

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of cybersecurity concepts (threats, vulnerabilities, assets).
- Familiarity with Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets and Word/Google Docs.
- Complete this lab with the [[Home Network Security Checklist]]

---

### Project Scope

For this project, you will assess a **home network** and the **personal devices** connected to it, such as laptops, smartphones, tablets, and IoT devices (e.g., smart TVs, home assistants). The main goals are to identify potential vulnerabilities, assess the impact of those risks, and recommend ways to mitigate them.

---

### Part 1: Risk Identification

1. **Define the Scope**:
   - Choose one friend or family member's home network and devices. Be sure to get their permission to perform the risk assessment.
   - Scope example: Assessing cybersecurity risks on a home Wi-Fi network, personal laptop, and smartphone.

2. **Identify Assets**:
   - List the main assets that could be impacted by cybersecurity threats. Assets are the devices and systems connected to the network, as well as any sensitive data they store.
   - **Examples of assets**: Home Wi-Fi network, laptop, smartphone, smart speaker, sensitive data (photos, financial information).

3. **Identify Threats**:
   - List potential threats to each asset. A **threat** is any event or action that could harm the asset.
   - **Examples of threats**: Unauthorized access, phishing, malware, eavesdropping on network traffic.

4. **Identify Vulnerabilities**:
   - Identify any **vulnerabilities** (weaknesses) in each asset that could allow threats to impact the device or network.
   - **Examples of vulnerabilities**: Weak Wi-Fi passwords, unpatched software, no antivirus protection.

5. **Document Your Findings**:
   - Create a **Risk Identification Table** in a spreadsheet to organize your findings.

   **Risk Identification Table Example**:

| Asset         | Threat              | Vulnerability                         |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Home Wi-Fi    | Unauthorized Access | Weak password                         |
| Laptop        | Malware             | No antivirus installed                |
| Smartphone    | Phishing            | No email filtering                    |
| Smart Speaker | Eavesdropping       | Default factory settings              |


---

### Part 2: Risk Analysis and Evaluation

In this step, you will evaluate each risk by considering the **likelihood** of it happening and the **impact** if it does.

1. **Assess Likelihood**:
   - Rate the likelihood of each risk on a scale from 1-5, where 1 is Very Low and 5 is Very High.
   - Example: The likelihood of an unauthorized user guessing a weak Wi-Fi password might be rated as 3 (Moderate).

2. **Assess Impact**:
   - Rate the impact of each risk on a scale from 1-5, where 1 is Minimal and 5 is Severe.
   - Example: If unauthorized access to the Wi-Fi network could allow others to intercept sensitive data, the impact might be rated as 4 (High).

3. **Calculate Risk Level**:
   - Use the formula **Risk Level = Likelihood × Impact**.
   - This will help prioritize which risks need the most attention.

4. **Document Your Findings**:
   - Use a **Risk Analysis Table** in your spreadsheet to record likelihood, impact, and risk level.

   **Risk Analysis Table Example**:

| Asset         | Threat              | Vulnerability               | Likelihood (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Risk Level |
|---------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| Home Wi-Fi    | Unauthorized Access | Weak password               | 3                 | 4            | 12         |
| Laptop        | Malware             | No antivirus installed      | 4                 | 3            | 12         |
| Smartphone    | Phishing            | No email filtering          | 3                 | 2            | 6          |
| Smart Speaker | Eavesdropping       | Default factory settings    | 2                 | 4            | 8          |

### Part 3: Risk Mitigation and Documentation

In this section, you will recommend mitigation strategies for each risk. Mitigation can include actions such as changing settings, installing protective software, or educating the user.

1. **Identify Mitigation Options**:
   - For each risk, propose a specific action to reduce the risk level.
   - Example: For a weak Wi-Fi password, you might recommend creating a strong, unique password.

2. **Re-evaluate Risk Levels**:
   - After listing the mitigation strategies, adjust the likelihood and impact ratings based on expected improvements.
   
3. **Document Your Findings**:
   - Create a **Risk Mitigation Plan** table with columns for the new Likelihood, Impact, and Risk Level, as well as Responsible Party (if applicable) and Completion Date.

   **Risk Mitigation Plan Example**:

  1. **Risk Mitigation Plan Example**:
    
| Risk ID | Asset         | Threat              | Mitigation Action                     | New Likelihood | New Impact | New Risk Level | Responsible Party | Completion Date |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------|------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 1       | Home Wi-Fi    | Unauthorized Access | Create a strong, unique Wi-Fi password| 1              | 4          | 4              | Family Member     | 2023-11-30      |
| 2       | Laptop        | Malware             | Install antivirus software            | 2              | 3          | 6              | Self              | 2023-11-30      |
| 3       | Smartphone    | Phishing            | Enable email filtering                | 2              | 2          | 4              | Self              | 2023-11-30      |
| 4       | Smart Speaker | Eavesdropping       | Change default settings               | 1              | 3          | 3              | Family Member     | 2023-11-30      |
