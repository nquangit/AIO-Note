## Penetration Testing with OWASP Juice Shop

OWASP Juice Shop is a purposefully insecure web application designed to teach web security by simulating a variety of common vulnerabilities. This project will guide you through setting up Juice Shop, exploring its interface, and understanding some basic methods for identifying security issues.

---

### Prerequisites

- **Basic knowledge of web application security** (helpful, but not required).
- **A computer with Docker installed** (recommended for easy setup).
- **A web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, or similar).

> **Tip**: If Docker isn’t an option, you can install Juice Shop directly on your computer without it, though Docker makes setup much easier.

---

### Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Set Up Juice Shop

There are two primary ways to run Juice Shop: using Docker (recommended) or installing it manually.

#### Option A: Using Docker (Recommended)

1. **Install Docker**
   - Ensure Docker is installed by running `docker --version` in a terminal.
   - If you don’t have Docker, you can download it from [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Run OWASP Juice Shop with Docker**
   - In a terminal, pull the latest Juice Shop image by running:

     ```bash
     docker pull bkimminich/juice-shop
     ```

   - Once the image is downloaded, start Juice Shop by running:

     ```bash
     docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop
     ```

   - Juice Shop will start running on `http://localhost:3000`.

> **Tip**: Docker will download the image only the first time. After that, starting Juice Shop will be much faster.

#### Option B: Manual Installation

1. **Install Node.js**
   - Ensure you have Node.js installed by running `node -v` in a terminal.
   - If it’s not installed, download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Install Juice Shop**
   - Open a terminal and install Juice Shop globally by running:

     ```bash
     npm install -g juice-shop
     ```

3. **Start Juice Shop**
   - Start the application by running:

     ```bash
     juice-shop
     ```

   - Juice Shop will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

---

### Step 2: Explore the Juice Shop Interface

1. **Open Juice Shop in Your Browser**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. You’ll see a web store interface with various products and features.

2. **Create an Account**
   - To fully explore the application, sign up for an account using the “Account” menu.
   - Use a real or dummy email address to create an account.

3. **Familiarize Yourself with the Interface**
   - Click around the site to explore the various features, such as the product catalog, shopping cart, and user profile sections.

> **Note**: Juice Shop contains hidden challenges and vulnerabilities in almost every feature. Explore the site to get a feel for where security issues might be lurking.

### Step 3: Identify and Solve Vulnerabilities

OWASP Juice Shop has challenges of varying difficulty levels. Let’s start by identifying a simple vulnerability.

1. **Access the Challenges**
   - Go to the “Score Board” page by clicking on the small trophy icon at the bottom of the page or by visiting `http://localhost:3000/#/score-board`.
   - The Score Board lists available challenges, categorized by difficulty.

2. **Complete a Simple Challenge**

   - **Example Challenge**: “Find the API endpoint that reveals all users’ emails.”
   - **Hint**: Many challenges can be completed by examining API requests.
   - **Solution**:
     1. Open your browser’s Developer Tools (usually available under the "Inspect" or "Developer Tools" menu).
     2. Go to the **Network** tab.
     3. Browse the site, especially pages that display user information.
     4. Look for API requests that include user data, particularly anything that reveals email addresses or sensitive information.

3. **Submit Challenges**
   - Once you complete a challenge, the Score Board will update automatically, and you’ll earn points.

> **Tip**: Use the Score Board’s hints to get ideas on solving challenges if you get stuck.

---

### Step 4: Practice Common Security Techniques

1. **Identify Input Fields**:
   - Look for any user input fields, such as login forms, search bars, and comments.
   - Try entering special characters (e.g., `';--` for SQL Injection or `<script>alert("XSS")</script>` for XSS) to see if the application is vulnerable to input attacks.

2. **Check for Hidden Content**:
   - Sometimes, Juice Shop hides sensitive content in its HTML source code.
   - Right-click on the page and select “View Page Source” to inspect the HTML and look for hidden challenges or hints.

3. **Experiment with Authentication Bypass**:
   - Test if certain parts of the site are accessible without logging in by opening private/incognito browser windows and navigating to URLs you previously visited.

> **Note**: These tests are safe in Juice Shop but should never be conducted on live applications without authorization.

---

### Step 5: Track Your Progress and Learn from Solutions

1. **Review Your Completed Challenges**
   - Check the Score Board to see which challenges you’ve completed and read the descriptions for any helpful notes or explanations.

2. **Use the Hints**
   - Each challenge has hints that can help guide you toward the solution.
   - Hints are available in the Score Board and often provide clues related to the vulnerability type or the general area of the application you should investigate.

3. **Refer to the OWASP Juice Shop Documentation**
   - Juice Shop’s documentation includes detailed explanations of each vulnerability and general solutions. This is a great way to learn about web security best practices.

---

### Step 6: Document Your Findings and Observations

1. **Create a Report**
   - Document the vulnerabilities you found, including:
     - The type of vulnerability (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS).
     - Steps you took to identify and exploit the vulnerability.
     - How the vulnerability could be mitigated in a real application.

2. **List Security Best Practices**
   - Write down security practices you learned from Juice Shop, such as input validation, session management, and API security.

3. **Reflect on Learning Outcomes**
   - Summarize key takeaways, such as which vulnerabilities were easiest or most challenging and what you learned about securing web applications.
