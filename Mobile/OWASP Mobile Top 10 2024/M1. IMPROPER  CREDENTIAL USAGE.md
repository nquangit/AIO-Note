# Am I Vulnerable To ‘Improper Credential Usage’?

- **Hardcoded Credentials** - If the mobile app contains hardcoded credentials within the app’s source code or any configuration files, this is a clear indicator of vulnerability.
- **Insecure Credential Transmission** - If credentials are transmitted without encryption or through insecure channels, this could indicate a vulnerability.
- **Insecure Credential Storage** - If the mobile app stores user credentials on the device in an insecure manner, this could represent a vulnerability.
- **Weak User Authentication** - If user authentication relies on weak protocols or allows for easy bypassing, this could be a sign of vulnerability.
