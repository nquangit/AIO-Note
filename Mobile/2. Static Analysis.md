> Goal: Known how to use MobSF and what static analysis is

# Auto Check

- To make the work easier, for static phase, we first using MobSF to automated generate an overview of
the app
- MobSF is an automated, all in one mobile application (Android/iOS/Windows) pen testing framework
capable of performing static analysis, dynamic analysis, malware analysis and web API testing

**Github**: https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF
**Or**: https://mobsf.live

Some valuable information:
- Manifest
- Permission
- String
- Signer Certificate

# Manual Check

> Tool: ByteCode Viewer

**Github**: https://www.bytecodeviewer.com/

- Use Malicious Code Scanner plugin for quick check malicious code

Purpose:
- In Static Phase, we have to check if the app had anti root, anti-VM , cert-pinning installed 
- Check if the key, password, etc is hard-coded in code, folder.
- Check if sensitive data is saved in database (unencrypt password, credit card
- etc

## Inside check

### Unencrypted Data/Credentials In Databases

- Try to login or use the application to store the usage data (credentials, ...)
- From the computer, ssh into the device via command: adb shell
- Go to /data/<app_name>/
- Read all databases in this folder using SQLite tool

### Sensitive Data Storage in Plain Text

- Use the app
- Go to /data/<app_name> 
- Check if the content of file in this folder is sensitive, some points: deviceId, uid , userId , imei , deviceSerialNumber , devicePrint , XDSN, phone, mdn , IMSI, uuid
- Command: grep -r ‘string to find’ $(find)

### Insecure Cookie Storage

- Cookie data is saved unsafe and didn’t expired, the attacker can use it to hijack the session
- Check in the folder if any cookie data exists, copy it and paste to the request to see if we are authenticated

### Unencrypted Backup File

- If app allows to backup data, check this backup to see if it contain sensitive data.
```xml
android:allowBackup = "true"
```
- Login into app/use app
- Type following command to create backup
```bash
adb backup -apk -shared com.android.insecurebankv2
```
- Unlock your phone and Allow to backup data. The backup file will be named "backup.ab"
- Convert it to readable file
```bash
cat backup.ab | dd bs =24 count=0 skip=1; cat) | zlib flate uncompress > backup_compressed.tar
```

### Sensitive Information Leaked Through Logs

- Data is leaked via system log
- Type the following command to watch log: adb logcat 
- Try Login and view the log

### Weak Custom Cryptography Methodology

- Data is encrypt in weak cryptography methodology

### Activity Hijacking

- In AndroidManifest.xml , if the activity exported set to true, user can hijack the flow and run this activity
- As you see, the activity com.android.insecurebankv2.PostLogin is export as true
- Now go to device shell via command: adb shell
- Call activity manager (am)
	Within an adb shell, you can issue commands with the activity manager (am) tool to perform various
system actions, such as start an activity, force stop a process, broadcast an intent, modify the device
screen properties, and more
- So to hijack the activity PostLogin (which is the dashboard), we type the following command
```bash
am start -n com.android.insecurebankv2/.PostLogin
```
