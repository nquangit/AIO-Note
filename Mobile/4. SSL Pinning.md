# Description

- SSL Pinning is the process of associating a host with their expected X.509 certificate or public key. Once a
certificate or public key is known or seen for a host, the certificate or public key is associated or ‘pinned’ to
the host.
- Applications communicating over HTTPS and using Pinning makes it non-trivial to perform Man-In-The-
Middle attack and grab the network traffic in clear text using the proxy tools.
# Detect Pinning

- To check if SSL Pinning is implemented or not, there are some ways
1. You will be able to intercept the first request and not other request (or can’t intercept request)
2. Search for strings “Trusted”
- Use MobSF
(Left menu) Security Analysis tab -> File Analysis.
If you find "Certificate/Key Files Hard-coded inside the App” or something contains the word “Pinning” => Pinning

# Bypass The Pinning

## Method 1: Adding a Custom CA to the User Certificate Store
- By default, secure connections (using protocols like TLS and HTTPS) from all apps trust
the pre-installed system CAs, and apps targeting Android 6.0 (API level 23) and lower
also trust the user-added CA store by default
- If we have valid trusted certificate, we pass

⇒ Let add our custom CA
- First we get the burp certificate (set the browser proxy via burp) by accessing http://burp
- Then push it into our virtual device:
```bash
adb push cacert.der /sdcard/Download/cacert.der
# Android cert doesn't understand .der extension, so we have to change it to .cer
mv cacert.der cacert.cer
```
- Now we go to Settings -> Security -> Install from SD card
- Come to /sdcard/Download/ folder, we see our pushed cert, click it
- Then fill like below and click OK
- Now go to Trusted credentials and check if our cert is installed
- So, ssl request is proxied via burpsuite using PortSwigger CA, which is valid cert installed, we pass
- Sometime, the developer force us using android 7 to avoid this trick. It’s defined in AndroidManifest.xml
```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" package="com.pinning_app.app" platformBuildVersionCode="25" platformBuildVersionName="7.0">
```
- So we decompile it using apktool, change to:
```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" package="com.pinning_app.app" platformBuildVersionCode="23" platformBuildVersionName="6.0">
```
- Then recompile it, if the application is only validating on valid certificate, this technique should allow you to
establish a successful MITM condition.

## Method 2: Overwrite Packaged CA Certificate with Custom CA Certificate

- Sometime when decompile the apk, you will find some CA in the directory
```
ls /<app_name>/assets
# Maybe it has file: signing.crt 
```
- Just Overwrite the ‘CustomCA.cer’ certificate with our custom CA should allow us to trick the application into accepting our certificate.
## Method 3: Patch the app

- Yes, patch the app, decompile the apk, find CertPinning smali code, change it J

## Method 4: Hook

- Frida time.
#### Objection
- Objection was built with the aim of helping assess mobile applications and their security posture without the
need for a jailbroken or rooted mobile device.

##### Setup
- To Install, simply type command:
```bash
pip3 install objection
```
- Test if it is installed:
```bash
objection
```
- To use Objection, you need two things:
1. Objection installed
2. A patched APK installed to your android device and with the device connected and authorized to your computer via USB
- We already got the first thing, so we will create a patched APK, type command:
```bash
objection patchapk --source InsecureBankv2.apk
```
(More about this: https://github.com/sensepost/objection/wiki/Patching-Android-Applications)
- We install the patched apk on the phone:
```bash
adb install InsecureBankv2.objection.apk
```
Run the app on phone, then type this command to explore it:
```bash
objection --gadget "com.android.InsecureBankv2" explore
```
- With Objection, we can easily collect app information, for example the env command will print out the locations of the applications Files, Caches and other directories:
```bash
# In objection prompt
env
```
- Or list all of the Activities that the application has:
```
android hooking list activities
```
- Using the output from the activities list, invoking arbitrary activities is as simple as:
```bash
android intent launch_activity com.android.insecurebankv2.PostLogin
```

> Bypass SSL Pinning using Objection, simply type command (although this app have no pinning, just example):

```bash
android sslpinning disable
```
