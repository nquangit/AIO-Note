### Cybersecurity Lab: Developing Home Network Security Policies and Procedures

This lab will guide you through creating **cybersecurity policies and procedures** for a friend or family member’s home network using the **Home Network Security Checklist**. Security policies provide high-level guidelines, while procedures define step-by-step actions to enforce these policies. This lab simulates real-world GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) tasks of establishing security policies to protect home environments.

### Lab Outline

This lab consists of five main steps:

1. **Identify Security Needs Using the Checklist**
2. **Define Policy Goals and Scope**
3. **Draft Security Policies**
4. **Develop Procedures for Each Policy**
5. **Create the Home Network Security Policies and Procedures Document**

---

## Step 1: Identify Security Needs Using the Checklist

To create effective policies, you’ll use the **[[Home Network Security Checklist]]** to identify areas where policies will help address security risks.

1. **Review Key Security Areas in the Checklist**  
   Use the checklist to identify essential areas where policies would improve security, including:
   - **Network Security**: Wi-Fi encryption, password strength, and router updates.
   - **Device Security**: Antivirus software, device updates, and screen locks.
   - **Access Control**: User accounts, passwords, and two-factor authentication.
   - **Data Protection**: Backup and encryption for critical data.
   - **IoT Device Security**: Passwords, firmware updates, and network segmentation.

2. **Identify Key Security Risks**  
   Assess the primary risks for each area that a policy could mitigate.
   - *Example*: If weak Wi-Fi passwords are a risk, a **Network Security Policy** can require strong passwords and WPA2/3 encryption.

3. **Document Security Needs**  
   Create a list of security areas and the policies that will address them.

**Example Security Needs Table**:

| Security Area          | Identified Risk                                      | Policy Needed               |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Network Security       | Weak Wi-Fi password, no WPA2/3 encryption            | Network Security Policy     |
| Device Security        | Lack of antivirus, outdated software                 | Device Security Policy      |
| Access Control         | Uncontrolled access to devices                       | Access Control Policy       |
| Data Protection        | Data loss or unauthorized data access                | Data Protection Policy      |
| IoT Device Security    | Default passwords, unsegmented network               | IoT Device Security Policy  |

---

## Step 2: Define Policy Goals and Scope

Each policy should have a clear goal and scope specifying its purpose and coverage.

1. **Define Policy Goals**  
   Set a goal for each policy to address a specific security need.
   - *Example Goal for Network Security Policy*: “To protect the home network from unauthorized access by enforcing strong Wi-Fi security settings.”

2. **Set Policy Scope**  
   Define the scope of each policy, identifying who and what it applies to.
   - *Example Scope for Network Security Policy*: “This policy applies to the home Wi-Fi network, all connected devices, and users accessing the network.”

3. **Document Goals and Scope**  
   Organize the goals and scope in a table to guide policy creation.

**Example Goals and Scope Table**:

| Policy                  | Goal                                                  | Scope                            |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Network Security Policy | Ensure strong Wi-Fi security                          | Wi-Fi network and all users      |
| Device Security Policy  | Protect devices from malware and unauthorized access  | All personal and shared devices  |
| Access Control Policy   | Control access to sensitive devices and accounts      | All household users              |
| Data Protection Policy  | Secure important data and backups                     | All data on devices              |
| IoT Device Security Policy | Secure IoT devices from unauthorized access       | All IoT devices in the home      |

## Step 3: Draft Security Policies

Use the identified needs and goals to draft high-level security policies that establish security requirements without specifying technical details (these will be covered in procedures).

### How to Draft a Policy

1. **Include Key Elements**  
   - **Purpose**: Briefly state the reason for the policy.
   - **Scope**: Define to whom and what the policy applies.
   - **Policy Statement**: Articulate the rules and requirements of the policy.
   - **Roles and Responsibilities**: Specify who is responsible for enforcing the policy.
   - **Compliance**: Describe consequences for not following the policy.

2. **Write Sample Policy Statements**  
   Use simple, clear language that is easy for non-technical users to understand.
   - *Example Network Security Policy Statement*:  
     “The home Wi-Fi network must be secured with WPA2/WPA3 encryption and a strong password of at least 12 characters, including numbers and symbols.”

3. **Draft Each Policy**  
   Write each policy as a separate section in your document, following a consistent format.

**Sample Policy Template**:

**[Policy Name] Policy**  
**Purpose**: To protect the home network from unauthorized access.  
**Scope**: Applies to the home Wi-Fi network and all connected devices.  
**Policy Statement**:  
- Wi-Fi must be protected with WPA2/WPA3 encryption.
- The Wi-Fi password must be at least 12 characters, using a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.  
**Roles and Responsibilities**: Network administrator/homeowner  
**Compliance**: Wi-Fi password will be updated every six months.

## Step 4: Develop Procedures for Each Policy

Procedures provide detailed steps for implementing each policy. These should be practical and easy to follow.

1. **Identify Steps for Each Procedure**  
   Break down each policy statement into actionable steps.
   - *Example for Network Security Procedure*:  
     Step 1: Log into the router’s administrative interface.  
     Step 2: Change the Wi-Fi password to a complex, unique password.  
     Step 3: Ensure WPA2/WPA3 encryption is enabled.

2. **Create a Procedure Template**  
   Ensure consistency by using a template for each procedure, covering Purpose, Scope, Step-by-Step Instructions, and Review.

3. **Write Step-by-Step Instructions**  
   Procedures should be detailed and easy to understand for a non-technical audience.

**Sample Procedure Template**:

**[Procedure Name] Procedure**  
**Purpose**: To ensure that the home Wi-Fi network is secure.  
**Scope**: Applies to all devices connecting to the Wi-Fi network.  
**Step-by-Step Instructions**:  
1. Log in to the router using the administrator password.  
2. Navigate to Wi-Fi security settings.  
3. Update the Wi-Fi password to meet policy requirements.  
**Review and Approval**: Network administrator or homeowner.

## Step 5: Create the Home Network Security Policies and Procedures Document

Compile all policies and procedures into a single document for easy reference. This document serves as a guide for maintaining secure practices on the home network.

1. **Organize the Document**  
   Arrange policies by security area and include corresponding procedures immediately following each policy.

2. **Add a Table of Contents**  
   Include a table of contents for easy navigation.

3. **Review for Clarity**  
   Ensure all policies and procedures are easy to understand and follow.

**Example Document Structure**:

### Home Network Security Policies and Procedures

**Table of Contents**  
1. Network Security Policy and Procedure  
2. Device Security Policy and Procedure  
3. Access Control Policy and Procedure
