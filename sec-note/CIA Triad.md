# CIA Triad

The **CIA Triad** is a fundamental model in cybersecurity, representing the three core principles of information security: **[[Confidentiality]], [[Integrity]], and [[Availability]]**. It serves as the foundation for designing secure systems and managing security risks.

## Key Features

- **[[Confidentiality]]:** Ensures that information is accessible only to those authorized to view or use it, protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.
- **[[Integrity]]:** Maintains the accuracy and consistency of data, ensuring it has not been altered or tampered with, either in storage or transit.
- **[[Availability]]:** Ensures that information and systems are accessible to authorized users whenever they are needed, without delays or interruptions.

## Problem Addressed

The CIA Triad addresses the core security concerns for protecting information in digital systems:

- **[[Confidentiality]]** prevents data breaches and unauthorized access.
- **[[Integrity]]** safeguards against data tampering, ensuring information remains trustworthy.
- **[[Availability]]** ensures that legitimate users can access systems and data when needed, despite potential disruptions like cyberattacks or hardware failures.

## Implications

- **Holistic Security:** The CIA Triad is essential in developing a balanced cybersecurity strategy, ensuring that no single aspect of security is neglected.
- **[[Risk Management]]:** By focusing on [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]], and [[availability]], organizations can better assess and mitigate risks related to data breaches, system downtime, and data manipulation.
- **Compliance and Governance:** Many regulatory frameworks (e.g., [[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|GDPR]], [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)|HIPAA]]) are built around these principles, making the CIA Triad critical for legal compliance.

## Impact

- **Data Protection:** Strong [[confidentiality]] practices prevent sensitive information, such as personal data or proprietary information, from falling into the wrong hands.
- **System Reliability:** Ensuring the [[integrity]] and [[availability]] of data keeps systems operational and trusted by users, minimizing costly errors and downtime.
- **Comprehensive Security Architecture:** The CIA Triad helps organizations structure their security measures around these three core principles, leading to more robust defenses.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **[[Encryption]] ([[Confidentiality]]):** Secures data in transit and at rest, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **[[Access Control]] ([[Confidentiality]]):** Ensures that only authorized personnel can access certain systems or data.
- **Hashing and Checksums ([[Integrity]]):** Used to verify that data has not been altered during storage or transmission.
- **Backup Systems ([[Integrity]]/[[Availability]]):** Protects against data corruption or deletion by providing restore points in case of attack or failure.
- **Redundancy and Failover ([[Availability]]):** Ensures system uptime and [[availability]] by duplicating critical infrastructure or using alternative resources during outages.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

- **Weak Access Controls ([[Confidentiality]]):** Poorly implemented access controls can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Data Manipulation ([[Integrity]]):** Attackers can alter data if systems are not properly secured, leading to loss of trust in the accuracy of the information.
- **Denial-of-Service Attacks ([[Availability]]):** These attacks flood systems with traffic or requests, making them unavailable to legitimate users.
- **Single Points of Failure ([[Availability]]):** Systems without redundancy can be exploited, causing prolonged downtime if a failure occurs.

## Common Tools/Software

- **[[Encryption Tools]]:** **GPG**, **SSL/TLS**, and **BitLocker** help protect [[confidentiality]] by encrypting sensitive data.
- **Backup Solutions:** **Acronis**, **Veeam**, and **AWS Backup** ensure data [[availability]] by providing restoration options after failures or cyberattacks.
- **[[Integrity]] Tools:** **Tripwire** monitors system changes, ensuring the [[integrity]] of data and alerting administrators to unauthorized alterations.
- **[[Intrusion Detection Systems|Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)]]:** Tools like **Snort** and **Suricata** monitor for unusual activity that might threaten any part of the CIA Triad.

## Current Status

The CIA Triad continues to be the core model for [[cybersecurity frameworks]], with new technologies enhancing each component. Modern [[encryption]] [[Algorithm|algorithms]], more sophisticated [[access control]] mechanisms, and advanced backup systems have been developed to reinforce [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]], and [[availability]] in increasingly complex environments.
