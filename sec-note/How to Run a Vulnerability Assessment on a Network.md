# **Vulnerability Assessment on a Network**

**Goal:** A vulnerability assessment is a way to check for weaknesses in a computer network that attackers could exploit. In this project, you'll set up and perform a vulnerability assessment on a network using a scanning tool, either Nessus or OpenVAS. These tools will help you find security issues so you can take action to secure the network.

---

## **Prerequisites**

To complete this project, you'll need:

- **Basic knowledge of networking and security:** If you're new to networking, consider reviewing basic terms like "IP addresses" and "network devices." Beginner-friendly resources like [this networking basics tutorial](https://www.comptia.org/content/guides/what-is-networking) can help.
- **A computer with internet access**
- **A network to scan**: This could be your home network, a test network, or a set of devices you have permission to scan.

---

## **Step-by-Step Guide**

### **Step 1: Choose and Install a Vulnerability Assessment Tool**

There are two main tools you can use for this project:

1. **Nessus**:
   - **Why choose it?** Nessus is a widely-used tool that’s beginner-friendly, with a free "Nessus Essentials" version for personal use.
   - **Download and install**:
     - Visit the Nessus download page at [https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus).
     - Choose the version for your operating system (like Windows, Mac, or Linux) and download it.
     - Follow the installation instructions on the website.

2. **OpenVAS** (also known as Greenbone Vulnerability Manager):
   - **Why choose it?** OpenVAS is an open-source (free) vulnerability scanner. It works well on Linux systems.
   - **Download and install**:
     - If you're using Ubuntu, open your terminal and enter the following commands:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install openvas
     sudo gvm-setup
     sudo gvm-start
     ```
     - These commands will install and start OpenVAS. Make sure to follow any instructions that appear in the terminal.

*Note:* Choose one of these tools to complete the lab, but you don’t need to install both.

---

### **Step 2: Configure the Vulnerability Scanner**

Once the tool is installed, you'll need to configure it.

1. **Nessus Configuration**:
   - Open your web browser and go to `https://localhost:8834/` (localhost means it’s running on your computer).
   - Go through the setup process, which includes creating an admin account and activating Nessus using an activation code they’ll email you.
   - When setup is complete, log in to the Nessus web interface.

2. **OpenVAS Configuration**:
   - Open your web browser and go to `https://localhost:9392/`.
   - Log in with the admin username and password created during installation.

---

### **Step 3: Define the Target Network**

Now, tell the scanner what network or devices you want to assess.

1. **Identify the IP range of your network**:
   - If you’re scanning your home network, you might use an IP range like `192.168.1.0/24`, which covers all devices in a typical home network.

2. **Add the target in Nessus**:
   - In Nessus, go to `Scans` -> `New Scan`.
   - Choose the "Basic Network Scan" template.
   - Enter the scan details, including the **scan name** and **IP range**.
   - Save your scan settings.

3. **Add the target in OpenVAS**:
   - In OpenVAS, go to `Configuration` -> `Targets`.
   - Click on `New Target` and enter the target details, including the **target name** and **IP range**.
   - Save the target configuration.

---

### **Step 4: Run the Vulnerability Scan**

With the target set up, you can now start scanning for vulnerabilities.

1. **Start the scan in Nessus**:
   - Go to the `Scans` page in Nessus.
   - Find your configured scan, then click the `Play` (start) button to begin the scan.
   - Scans may take some time, depending on the number of devices.

2. **Start the scan in OpenVAS**:
   - In OpenVAS, go to `Scans` -> `Tasks`.
   - Click `New Task`, select the target, and start the scan.
   - You’ll see updates in the interface as it progresses.

---

### **Step 5: Analyze the Scan Results**

After the scan is complete, review the results to understand the vulnerabilities found.

1. **View results in Nessus**:
   - Click on the completed scan to see the details.
   - Review the list of discovered vulnerabilities, which may have severity levels like **Critical**, **High**, **Medium**, and **Low**.
   - Click each vulnerability to see information on what it is and how to fix it.

2. **View results in OpenVAS**:
   - Go to `Scans` -> `Reports` and select the scan report.
   - Review each vulnerability, focusing on the severity level and recommended fixes.

---

### **Step 6: Mitigate the Vulnerabilities**

Now that you know where the vulnerabilities are, focus on fixing them.

1. **Prioritize based on severity**:
   - Fix critical and high-severity vulnerabilities first since they pose the most risk.
2. **Apply updates and patches**:
   - Make sure all software and firmware on the devices are up to date.
3. **Follow security best practices**:
   - **Disable unnecessary services** (like remote access if it’s not needed).
   - **Use strong passwords** and enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.
   - Configure firewalls to block unnecessary access to your network.

4. **Re-scan after making fixes**:
   - Run the scan again to confirm that the vulnerabilities have been resolved.

---

### **Step 7: Document the Vulnerability Assessment**

Creating a report helps you (or your team) understand the network’s current security state.

1. **Create a report**:
   - List each identified vulnerability, along with a description, severity level, and what steps you took to fix it.
2. **Summarize key findings**:
   - Write an executive summary to highlight critical issues.
3. **Offer recommendations**:
   - Suggest steps to keep the network secure, like regular scans and prompt patching.

---

### **Conclusion**

You’ve now completed a vulnerability assessment using Nessus or OpenVAS, identified security weaknesses, and taken steps to address them. **Regular vulnerability assessments are crucial** to keep networks safe, so make this a habit and continue learning security best practices.
