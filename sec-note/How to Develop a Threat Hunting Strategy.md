### **Develop a Threat Hunting Strategy**

**Threat hunting** is the proactive search for threats and vulnerabilities within an organization’s network and systems. Rather than waiting for alerts, threat hunters actively look for signs of possible attacks or suspicious behavior. This project will guide you through creating and carrying out a threat hunting strategy that can strengthen your security.

---

#### **Prerequisites**
- **Basic cybersecurity knowledge** (understanding what threats are and why they matter)
- **Familiarity with security tools and log analysis**
- **A computer with internet access**

---
### **Step-by-Step Guide**

---

#### **Step 1: Define Objectives and Scope**

1. **Identify Objectives**:  
   - Set specific goals for what you want to achieve with threat hunting.  
   - Common objectives include:
     - **Detecting Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**: These are sophisticated attacks that hide within networks for long periods.
     - **Identifying Insider Threats**: This could involve employees misusing access or accounts.
     - **Uncovering Unknown Vulnerabilities**: Find weak points in systems that attackers could exploit.
   - **Tip**: Your objectives guide where and what you’ll look for during the hunt.

2. **Define the Scope**:
   - Set boundaries for your hunting activity by deciding what systems, networks, and data you’ll include.  
   - **Example**: You might choose to focus only on high-value targets like servers, network devices (such as firewalls and routers), and workstations. Including critical endpoints and sensitive data sources ensures you cover potential weak spots.

---

#### **Step 2: Establish a Baseline**

To effectively spot threats, you need a clear picture of what normal activity looks like. This is called establishing a **baseline**.

1. **Collect Baseline Data**:
   - Gather data showing normal activity levels in your environment. This includes:
     - **Logs** (records of events) from systems and applications
     - **Network traffic** (how data flows between devices)
     - **User activity** (logins, file access patterns, etc.)
   - **Tools**: Use a **SIEM** system like Splunk or the ELK Stack to collect and organize logs.

2. **Analyze Baseline Data**:
   - Study this data to identify typical patterns and behavior.
   - Document metrics (measurements) like:
     - **Network traffic volumes** during peak hours
     - **User activity patterns** (e.g., typical login times)
     - **System performance** benchmarks
   - **Tip**: Establishing a clear baseline helps you recognize unusual activity that could indicate a threat.

---

#### **Step 3: Develop Hypotheses**

With a baseline established, start thinking about potential threats and how they might show up in your environment.

1. **Identify Potential Threats**:
   - Use your objectives to pinpoint the specific threats you want to hunt for.  
   - Examples:
     - **Malware infections**: Indicators might include high network traffic or abnormal process activity.
     - **Phishing attacks**: These could lead to unusual login locations or failed logins.
     - **Insider threats**: Look for unexpected changes in access patterns or login times.

2. **Formulate Hypotheses**:
   - A **hypothesis** is a prediction about how a specific threat could appear in your data.
   - **Example**: If an insider threat is suspected, you might hypothesize that unusual login times or abnormal data access patterns could signal misuse.

---

#### **Step 4: Select and Configure Tools**

Choose tools that will help you monitor your network, investigate logs, and spot suspicious behavior.

1. **Choose Threat Hunting Tools**:
   - Consider tools for each type of data or activity you’re investigating. Some common options include:
     - **SIEM Systems** (e.g., Splunk, ELK Stack): For collecting and analyzing logs
     - **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools** (e.g., CrowdStrike, Carbon Black): For monitoring and responding to suspicious activity on devices
     - **Network Analysis Tools** (e.g., Wireshark, Zeek): To monitor data traffic and investigate anomalies
     - **Threat Intelligence Platforms** (e.g., MISP, ThreatConnect): These help identify known threat actors and patterns.

2. **Configure Tools**:
   - Set up each tool to capture data relevant to your hypotheses.
   - **Example**: Enable logging and monitoring for network traffic, user activity, and system performance. For EDR tools, make sure you’re logging any unusual activity on critical systems.

---

#### **Step 5: Perform Threat Hunting**

This is the active phase where you collect and analyze data to look for suspicious activity.

1. **Collect and Analyze Data**:
   - Use your tools to filter and examine data based on your hypotheses.
   - **Example**: In Splunk, search for unusual login times, or in Zeek, review network logs for unexpected outbound connections.

2. **Investigate Anomalies**:
   - An **anomaly** is any deviation from your baseline that may be a sign of a threat.
   - **Example**: If you find unusual login times, look deeper into the source, timing, and context of these logins to determine if they could be malicious.

---

#### **Step 6: Implement Remediation and Mitigation**

If you identify a confirmed threat, take steps to respond immediately and prevent similar threats in the future.

1. **Respond to Threats**:
   - Take immediate action to neutralize the threat.
   - **Examples**:
     - **Isolate** infected systems from the network.
     - **Remove malware** and run scans to confirm no other systems are infected.
     - **Change credentials** for any compromised accounts.

2. **Implement Mitigation Measures**:
   - Based on what you learned, set up measures to protect against future threats.
   - **Examples**:
     - Strengthen access controls (e.g., two-factor authentication).
     - Update security policies to reflect new protocols for suspicious activity detection.
     - Deploy additional security tools if needed.

---

#### **Step 7: Review and Refine the Strategy**

After completing your initial threat hunt, evaluate how effective it was and make improvements.

1. **Evaluate Effectiveness**:
   - Measure your success by reviewing how many threats you detected, how quickly you responded, and how effective the mitigation was.
   - **Example**: Check if response times improved and if your strategy reduced incident rates.

2. **Refine Hypotheses**:
   - Based on your findings, update your hypotheses to address new threats or patterns.
   - **Example**: If you discover a new attack vector (method), adjust your hypotheses to cover similar scenarios.

3. **Update Tools and Techniques**:
   - Stay up-to-date by adding relevant threat intelligence feeds or automating repetitive tasks.
   - **Example**: Integrate new threat intelligence feeds to detect emerging threats or configure automated alerts for specific threat indicators.

---

#### **Step 8: Document the Threat Hunting Strategy**

Creating clear documentation ensures that others can follow and improve upon your strategy in the future.

1. **Create a Threat Hunting Plan**:
   - Document the whole threat hunting process, including:
     - **Objectives and Scope**: Goals, systems monitored, and threat types.
     - **Hypotheses**: Each hypothesis and the expected indicators of a threat.
     - **Tools**: List of tools, configurations, and any customizations.
     - **Processes**: Specific steps taken to collect and analyze data.

2. **Share the Plan**:
   - Share the documentation with relevant stakeholders, such as security teams, management, or compliance officers.

3. **Schedule Regular Reviews**:
   - Plan for regular reviews to keep the strategy current.
   - **Example**: Set quarterly review meetings to discuss improvements and necessary adjustments.
