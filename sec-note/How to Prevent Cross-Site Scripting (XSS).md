## Prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability that allows attackers to inject harmful scripts into webpages. This project will teach you how to identify XSS vulnerabilities in a web application and secure your code to prevent these attacks.

---

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- **Basic Python and web development knowledge** (you should understand Flask basics and know how web forms work).
- **Python installed** on your computer (check by typing `python --version` in a terminal).

---

### Step 1: Set Up the Development Environment

To start, you’ll need Python, a virtual environment, and Flask installed.

1. **Install Python**

   - Confirm that Python is installed by running: `python --version`.
   - If not, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

   - Virtual environments help keep libraries organized per project.
   - Create and activate a virtual environment by running:

     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
     ```

3. **Install Flask**

   - Install Flask by running:

     ```bash
     pip install Flask
     ```

---

### Step 2: Create the Vulnerable Web Application

In this step, you’ll create a simple Flask app with a search form that’s vulnerable to XSS.

1. **Create the Application File (`app.py`)**

   - Create a new file called `app.py`. Copy and paste the following code:

     ```python
     from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string

     app = Flask(__name__)

     @app.route('/')
     def home():
         return 'Step into the XSS Testing and Mitigation tutorial! Bypass, secure, fortify.'

     @app.route('/search', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
     def search():
         if request.method == 'POST':
             query = request.form['query']
             # Vulnerable to XSS
             return render_template_string(f'<p>Search results for: {query}</p>')
         return '''
             <form method="post">
                 Search: <input type="text" name="query"><br>
                 <input type="submit" value="Search">
             </form>
         '''

     if __name__ == '__main__':
         app.run(debug=True)
     ```

   - **Explanation of Vulnerability**: This code displays user input directly on the page without any validation or filtering, making it vulnerable to XSS.

2. **Create a `requirements.txt` File**

   - This file lists the libraries your app needs. Create a `requirements.txt` file and add:

     ```makefile
     Flask==2.0.1
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   - Run the following command to install the libraries listed in `requirements.txt`:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Run the Application**

   - Start the app by running:

     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

   - The app will run at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Open this address in your browser.

---

### Step 3: Test for XSS Vulnerability

**Goal**: Check if the app is vulnerable to XSS by entering JavaScript code as user input.

1. **Access the Search Page**

   - Go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/search`.

2. **Test the Vulnerability**

   - In the **Search** field, enter `<script>alert('XSS');</script>`.
   - If the app is vulnerable, a pop-up box saying “XSS” will appear. This confirms that the input was treated as executable JavaScript, meaning the app is susceptible to XSS.

   > **Tip**: If no alert appears, double-check that the code matches exactly and the app is running in debug mode. Also, confirm you’re on the correct page (`/search`).

---

### Step 4: Mitigate XSS Vulnerability

To secure the app, you’ll modify the code to escape user input so that any entered code is treated as plain text, not executable JavaScript.

1. **Secure the `search` Function**

   - Modify the `search` function in `app.py` to use Flask’s `escape` function, which converts special characters into harmless HTML entities (like `<` to `&lt;`):

     ```python
     from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string, escape

     app = Flask(__name__)

     @app.route('/')
     def home():
         return 'Step into the XSS Testing and Mitigation tutorial! Bypass, secure, fortify.'

     @app.route('/search', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
     def search():
         if request.method == 'POST':
             query = escape(request.form['query'])  # Securely escape user input
             return render_template_string(f'<p>Search results for: {query}</p>')
         return '''
             <form method="post">
                 Search: <input type="text" name="query"><br>
                 <input type="submit" value="Search">
             </form>
         '''

     if __name__ == '__main__':
         app.run(debug=True)
     ```

2. **Test the Mitigation**

   - Restart the app (`python app.py`).
   - Enter the same script tag (`<script>alert('XSS');</script>`) on the search page.
   - This time, the alert should not appear, and the text `<script>alert('XSS');</script>` should display as plain text on the page. This confirms that user input is no longer executed as JavaScript.

---

### Step 5: Implement Additional Security Measures

For further protection, here are a few extra steps you can add:

1. **Use Flask’s Built-in Template Engine**

   - Flask’s `render_template` method, combined with an HTML file, automatically escapes user input, reducing the risk of XSS.
   - Update `app.py` to use an HTML template:

     ```python
     from flask import Flask, request, render_template, escape

     app = Flask(__name__)

     @app.route('/')
     def home():
         return 'Step into the XSS Testing and Mitigation tutorial! Bypass, secure, fortify.'

     @app.route('/search', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
     def search():
         if request.method == 'POST':
             query = escape(request.form['query'])
             return render_template('search.html', query=query)
         return '''
             <form method="post">
                 Search: <input type="text" name="query"><br>
                 <input type="submit" value="Search">
             </form>
         '''

     if __name__ == '__main__':
         app.run(debug=True)
     ```

   - **Create the `search.html` Template**

     Create a folder called `templates` in your project directory, and inside it, create `search.html`:

     ```html
     <!doctype html>
     <html lang="en">
     <head>
         <meta charset="utf-8">
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
         <title>Search Results</title>
     </head>
     <body>
         <div class="container">
             <p>Search results for: {{ query }}</p>
         </div>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```

2. **Add a Content Security Policy (CSP)**

   - A CSP is a security header that limits what JavaScript, CSS, and other resources can load, reducing the chance of XSS.
   - Add this code to `app.py`:

     ```python
     @app.after_request
     def set_security_headers(response):
         response.headers['Content-Security-Policy'] = "default-src 'self'"
         return response
     ```

   - This CSP only allows content from the same origin (`self`), blocking any untrusted scripts.

---

### Step 6: Document Your Application

Good documentation helps others understand your app and the security measures you’ve taken.

1. **Configuration Details**

   - Document key settings, like any CSP headers, template usage, and why they help prevent XSS.

2. **Security Measures**

   - List the security practices you implemented, such as input escaping, using `render_template`, and adding a CSP.

3. **Usage Instructions**

   - Include steps for setting up and running the app, especially for testing XSS vulnerabilities and verifying security fixes.

### Conclusion

Congratulations! You’ve created a web app, tested it for XSS vulnerabilities, and implemented fixes. This project shows the importance of escaping user input and using security features like CSPs to prevent XSS attacks. Keep learning and practicing secure coding to build more resilient applications!
