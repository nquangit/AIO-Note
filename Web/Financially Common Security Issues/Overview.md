- **Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) and Race Condition Issues**: These occur when the state of a resource changes between the time it's checked and when it's used. This can lead to issues like transferring money or points, or buying items simultaneously. It can also occur when changing the order during or after payment completion.
- **Parameter Manipulation**: Attackers can manipulate various parameters, such as price, currency, quantity, shipping address, and additional costs. This can allow them to buy items cheaper or for free. Response manipulation is also possible, where the server's response is altered to bypass security measures. Other parameter manipulation methods include repeating or omitting parameters, mass assignment and object injection.
- **Replay Attacks**: Attackers can intercept and replay messages between the client and server, including callback requests and encrypted parameters. This can lead to unauthorized transactions.
- **Rounding Errors**: These occur due to the limited precision of numerical variables. They can be exploited in currency conversions and other calculations within the application.
- **Numerical Processing**: Issues related to how numbers are handled in the application, such as negative numbers, decimal numbers, large or small numbers, overflows and underflows, zero/null/subnormal numbers, exponential notation, reserved words and different number formats. These can be manipulated to bypass validations or cause logical flaws.
- **Card Number-Related Issues**: This includes revealing saved card numbers, and card number enumeration by registering duplicate cards.
- **Dynamic Prices**: Testing for vulnerabilities when prices change dynamically, and may include a margin of threshold.
- **Discount Codes, Vouchers, Offers, Reward Points, and Gift Cards**: These should be tested for enumeration and guessing, stacking, earning more points than the price of an item, using expired/invalid codes, state and basket manipulation, refund abuse, buy-x-get-y-free offers, ordering out-of-stock items, and point transfer issues.
- **Cryptography Issues**: Flaws in the implementation of cryptographic methods like encryption and hashing. This can include the use of insecure secret keys, length-extension attacks, and a lack of delimiters.
- **Downloadable and Virtual Goods**: These can be vulnerable to direct object reference attacks.
- **Hidden and Insecure Backend APIs**: These are often old and insecure, and can be vulnerable to various attack techniques.
- **Using Test Data in Production Environment**: The presence of test payment methods and dummy data in live environments. This can allow attackers to bypass security measures and make transactions without spending real money.
- **Currency Arbitrage**: Exploiting differences in exchange rates between different payment methods to gain profit.
