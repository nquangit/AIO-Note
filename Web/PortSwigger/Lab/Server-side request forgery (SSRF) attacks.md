## Lab: Basic SSRF against the local server

1. Browse to `/admin` and observe that you can't directly access the admin page.
2. Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.
3. Change the URL in the `stockApi` parameter to `http://localhost/admin`. This should display the administration interface.
4. Read the HTML to identify the URL to delete the target user, which is:
    
    `http://localhost/admin/delete?username=carlos`
5. Submit this URL in the `stockApi` parameter, to deliver the SSRF attack.

## Lab: Basic SSRF against another back-end system

1. Visit a product, click **Check stock**, intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Intruder.
2. Change the `stockApi` parameter to `http://192.168.0.1:8080/admin` then highlight the final octet of the IP address (the number `1`) and click **Add ยง**.
3. In the **Payloads** side panel, change the payload type to **Numbers**, and enter 1, 255, and 1 in the **From** and **To** and **Step** boxes respectively.
4. Click **Start attack**.
5. Click on the **Status** column to sort it by status code ascending. You should see a single entry with a status of `200`, showing an admin interface.
6. Click on this request, send it to Burp Repeater, and change the path in the `stockApi` to: `/admin/delete?username=carlos`

## Lab: SSRF with blacklist-based input filter

1. Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.
2. Change the URL in the `stockApi` parameter to `http://127.0.0.1/` and observe that the request is blocked.
3. Bypass the block by changing the URL to: `http://127.1/`
4. Change the URL to `http://127.1/admin` and observe that the URL is blocked again.
5. Obfuscate the "a" by double-URL encoding it to %2561 to access the admin interface and delete the target user.

## Lab: SSRF with filter bypass via open redirection vulnerability

HTTP Request Body:

```
stockApi=/product/nextProduct?path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin/delete?username=carlos
```


## Lab: Blind SSRF with out-of-band detection

1. Visit a product, intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.
2. Go to the Repeater tab. Select the Referer header, right-click and select "Insert Collaborator Payload" to replace the original domain with a Burp Collaborator generated domain. Send the request.
3. Go to the Collaborator tab, and click "Poll now". If you don't see any interactions listed, wait a few seconds and try again, since the server-side command is executed asynchronously.
4. You should see some DNS and HTTP interactions that were initiated by the application as the result of your payload.
